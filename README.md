## Business Case

Our customers (subscribers) seek help to build skills to deploy simple and viable batch pipelines entirely on Docker involving the following relational and NoSQL databases:
* Cassandra
* MySQL
* Redis

 
### Focus

I successfully engineered 3 batch data processing pipelines entirely on Docker.

I ingested, pre-processed and visualized the data in the database to validate their successful deployment.

## Data

I chose the [eCommerce behavior data from multi category store](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store) data to focus on successfully implementing the 3 batch pipelines.

However, the real business data I work with at my company and in most other situations requires more pre-processing than what I allowed myself to do in this project.

### Properties of data

 Data file contains behavior data for a 1 month (November 2019) from a large multi-category online store.
 
 Each row in the file represents an event.

* All events are related to products and users

* There are 3 different types of events
    * view
    * cart
    * purchase
